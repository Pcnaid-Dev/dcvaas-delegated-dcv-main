AutoCertify Marketing Site
Top Bar (Trust Bar)
At the very top of the AutoCertify homepage, there’s a slim trust bar with a support message: “Need help? Chat 24/7 · support@autocertify.com”. This immediately signals to a panicked visitor that help is readily available at any time. An optional lock icon and phrase “🔒 Secure & private” might also appear here as micro-trust indicators. This bar uses a small font and sits above the main navigation, reassuring users from the get-go.
Hero Section (Instant Fix Proposition)
Headline: “Fix the ‘Not Secure’ Warning on Your Website Instantly.”. This headline directly addresses the primary pain: the scary browser “Not Secure” label. It’s phrased in plain language and highlights immediacy (“Instantly”), tapping into the user’s urgent mindset.
Subheadline (Line 1): “Don’t lose customers to a security error. Get the Green Padlock in less than 5 minutes. No coding required.”. This line empathizes with the business impact (losing customers) and promises a fast, easy fix (green padlock in <5 minutes, non-technical solution).
Subheadline (Line 2): “We know how alarming that ‘Not Secure’ warning is. We’ll guide you step-by-step.”. This provides emotional reassurance, acknowledging the user’s fear and promising guidance through the process. Together, the subhead lines combine urgency with calming language.
Primary CTA: Secure My Site Now – a big green button (using the secure green color) inviting immediate action. This CTA is prominent and likely pulses or remains fixed/sticky as the user scrolls (on mobile, a sticky bottom bar CTA appears after the hero scroll).
Secondary CTA: Check my site first – a link styled as secondary action, opening a domain checker tool. This appeals to skeptical users who might want confirmation of a problem before signing up.
CTA Microcopy: “No credit card surprises. Cancel anytime. You’ll see progress immediately.”. Placed below the primary button, this assures users that they aren’t locked in or tricked into a payment – important for trust. The hero section likely features a visual of a browser address bar going from “Not Secure” (in red) to a green padlock “Secure” icon, illustrating the transformation. This might be an animation or static image showing before/after. On mobile, as specified, after the user scrolls past the hero, a sticky bottom bar appears with the primary CTA “Secure My Site Now” to ensure conversion opportunity is always present.
Benefits Section (4 Icon Cards)
Next, a series of four benefit highlights, typically shown as icon + short text pairs:
Instant Security Fix – “Turn the warning off fast—without digging into settings.”. Emphasizes speed and ease: the user doesn’t need technical know-how or to navigate complex settings. (Icon: a fast-forward symbol or a warning shield with a checkmark perhaps.)
Zero Downtime – “We verify everything before you switch, so your site stays live.”. Assures no outage during the fix, addressing the fear “Will my site go down if I mess with SSL?”. (Icon: maybe a clock or arrows forming a circle indicating continuity.)
Works with Everything – “WordPress, Shopify, Wix, ClickFunnels, custom sites—if it’s a website, we can secure it.”. Broad compatibility is a huge selling point for non-technical users. They see their platform or at least the reassurance that their scenario is covered. (Icons: multiple logos or a generic web icon with puzzle pieces.)
24/7 Automatic Protection – “We keep watch so you don’t have to think about it again.”. This conveys that once set up, the service monitors and renews SSL continuously. It’s not a one-off fix; it’s ongoing peace of mind. (Icon: maybe a shield or a moon+sun indicating around the clock.)
These four points correspond exactly to the reassurance chips shown earlier in the hero (which are listed with check marks). Here they’re expanded with one sentence each and likely accompanied by simple line icons (like a checkmark badge, a clock, a integration icon, a shield). The styling for this section is friendly: mint-tinted background (--color-surface mint) with white card elements for each benefit. The text is dark for readability, using a slightly larger size for the benefit title and normal text for the description.
“How It Works” Section (3-Step Process)
A prominent section, likely with a heading like “Secure your site in 3 simple steps”, outlines how easy the process is:
Step 1 – Sign up: “Enter your domain and email.”. Possibly depicted with an icon of a form or the number 1. Emphasize it’s just providing basic info, nothing complex.
Step 2 – Add one record (we guide you): “We show you exactly what to paste, with a ‘Copy’ button.”. This addresses the DNS step in simple terms. The user will be guided (the AI support widget can even detect their registrar to give specific guidance). It’s one DNS CNAME record, which the content doesn’t name in jargon here—just says “one record.”
Step 3 – You’re secure: “Big green check: Your site is safe now.”. Visualize a large checkmark or padlock. It implies that after verification, AutoCertify handles the rest, and the user sees the “Secure” padlock on their site.
Support microcopy: “Stuck? We’ll walk you through it in chat—24/7.”. This note ensures users that even these simple steps come with a lifeline if needed. Likely accompanied by a chat icon.
These steps are often represented by numbered illustrations or a horizontal stepper. On desktop, it might show 3 icons in a row with arrows; on mobile, maybe a vertical timeline. The language is extremely simple (no mention of ACME or DNS-01, etc.) to match the target user’s likely knowledge level.
Pricing Snippet
AutoCertify keeps pricing straightforward: usually a single plan. The site likely shows a section highlighting: “Just $15/month for peace of mind — secure up to 50 sites.”. This line communicates the price and value concisely, using the exact phrasing from the spec. The plan is called Business Pro and its features are enumerated: “Secure up to 50 custom domains. Instant setup. 24/7 Monitoring.” plus bullet list of included items: Instant setup, Automatic renewals, 24/7 monitoring, Guided setup (chat support).. All bullets have the green check ✅ for consistency. There is likely a call-to-action button repeating “Secure My Site Now” below the plan details to capture users at this point. Since only one plan is presented, there’s no comparison table needed, which keeps it simple (avoiding decision paralysis for the small biz owner). A note might mention something like “Includes all future renewals, no extra fees” to reassure about no hidden costs (though the microcopy already said “No credit card surprises”).
FAQ Section
AutoCertify includes a brief FAQ addressing the most common anxieties, each in Q/A format as given (and likely using FAQ structured data for SEO):
Q: Is this legit? – A: Yes. We use industry-standard SSL and best practices... same “secure” experience visitors expect.. This tackles trust – essentially “is this a scam or real SSL?” Reassures that it’s real SSL (likely Let’s Encrypt under the hood, but no need to name it; just say industry-standard).
Q: What do I need to do? – A: Usually just add one record... No coding.. Emphasizes simplicity: exactly one DNS change, nothing else. No code or dev required.
Q: Will my site go down? – A: No — Zero Downtime. We verify setup before switching.. Reiterates that the service won’t cause an outage, echoing the Zero Downtime benefit.
Q: Will it work with my website builder/host? – A: Works with Everything. WordPress, Shopify, Wix, ClickFunnels, and custom sites.. This is a critical question from non-tech users (worried “maybe my scenario is special”). The answer confidently covers all major cases.
Q: How will I know it’s fixed? – A: We show a live status, and you’ll see the green padlock once it’s active.. Explains the outcome: the app itself will tell them (the dashboard shows “Your Site is Secure” with a big check) and of course they can check their site’s URL for the padlock.
These answers are kept short and in plain English. Each Q/A likely appears in an accordion or list for easy scanning. This addresses final hesitations a user might have before clicking that CTA.
Footer
The footer is minimal to avoid overwhelming the user or distracting from conversion. It likely has only essential links: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service (since they might not rank anyway, maybe noindex if identical across brands). Possibly a small “© 2025 AutoCertify” and maybe “Powered by [ParentCo]” if applicable. It might also repeat the support email/phone. Crucially, it won’t link to DelegatedSSL or KeylessSSL overtly (maybe a small mention “For agencies, see DelegatedSSL” but that’s probably avoided in the footer due to SEO guidelines). More likely, any such cross-link is within content as discussed, not in a persistent nav. In summary, the AutoCertify marketing site is designed to convert a panicked, non-technical website owner quickly. The messaging is empathetic and simplified, focusing on immediate resolution, ease of use, and trust. The layout flows from identifying the problem to presenting the solution steps, then the cost (which is low-friction), and addressing likely questions. By the end, the user should feel “This sounds easy, affordable, and safe – I’ll click Secure My Site Now.”
