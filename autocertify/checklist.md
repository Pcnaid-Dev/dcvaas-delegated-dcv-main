AutoCertify Implementation Checklist
Setting up AutoCertify.net requires careful attention to its unique branding (consumer-friendly, urgent-yet-calm tone) and ensuring a smooth, guided user flow from panic to resolution. Below is the implementation to-do list:
 Brand Detection & Theming: Implement a brand resolver for AutoCertify. If the user is on autocertify.net (or the app/wizard subdomain), set data-brand="autocertify.net" on the HTML root. Load the AutoCertify CSS token set, which defines the green primary color scheme and larger base font sizes. Verify that all UI components (buttons, links, backgrounds) now use the mint/green AutoCertify style and that these meet accessibility (green on white should be okay, watch green text on mint background contrast).
 Green CTA Styling Everywhere: Replace the default primary CTA styles with AutoCertify’s green. Buttons on marketing pages and in-app should use --color-primary (#15803D green) with white text. Use the deeper green hover/active tokens for interactive states. Ensure this applies to the sticky mobile CTA bar as well. If any UI element was previously blue or another color, override it with green (e.g., links might remain green instead of typical blue to match brand).
 Marketing Top Bar (Support Bar): Implement the thin top support bar on the marketing site: text “Need help? Chat 24/7 · support@autocertify.com” with the lock icon and “Secure & private” optional bit. Make sure this bar is visible on desktop and collapses on mobile (or is maybe hidden on very small screens if space is tight). It should not be sticky (likely just sits at top and scrolls away). Also integrate the chat widget (e.g., Intercom or others) trigger on “Chat 24/7” or via an icon.
 Homepage Hero Implementation: The hero section needs the exact texts from microcopy: headline, subhead lines, and CTAs. Use the formatted text: “Fix the ‘Not Secure’ Warning on Your Website Instantly” as H1, sub-text lines as provided (with the second line italicized or smaller if design calls for it). Place the primary CTA button “Secure My Site Now” prominently and the secondary CTA “Check my site first” as a link or secondary button. Below them, include the microcopy note “No credit card surprises. Cancel anytime. You’ll see progress immediately.” (could be small italic or footnote style). Ensure responsive design: on mobile, the primary CTA might span full width and secondary may be just a link under it.
 Hero Visual: Add the browser bar visual showing “Not Secure” turning to a padlock. Possibly implement as an image or small script animation. If not provided, use a static image of an address bar with “Not Secure” and an arrow or fade to a “Secure” padlock icon. This visual should be accessible (alt text like “Browser ‘Not Secure’ warning turning into secure padlock”).
 Reassurance Chips: Right below the hero (or within it on some designs), show the four checkmark phrases (Zero Downtime, Works with Everything, etc.) as inline chips or a list. Each should have the green check emoji or icon as in copy. On mobile, ensure these wrap or are in a 2x2 grid so they’re not too tiny.
 Benefits Section: Implement the four benefit cards with icon + heading + short text. Use the microcopy: “Instant Security Fix — ...”, “Zero Downtime — ...” etc.. Use simple line icons (perhaps from a library) that match each benefit concept. These should be in a row on desktop (4 columns) and maybe a slider or 2x2 grid on mobile.
 How-It-Works Section: Create the 3-step horizontal section. Each step with a number or icon, short bold label and one-line description from microcopy. E.g., Step 1: “Sign up: Enter your domain and email.” etc. Possibly use the HowTo structured data markup here with steps. Include the support note “Stuck? We’ll walk you through it in chat—24/7.” after the steps. On mobile, this can be vertical steps (with numbers 1,2,3 down the page). On desktop, maybe a three-column layout or a stylized timeline.
 Pricing Section: Prominently show the plan: large text “$15/month” etc. Use the exact wording: “Just $15/month for peace of mind — secure up to 50 sites.” as a heading. Then list plan name and features: “Business Pro ($15/mo) — Secure up to 50 custom domains. Instant setup. 24/7 Monitoring.”, followed by bullet points: “✅ Instant setup · ✅ Automatic renewals · ✅ 24/7 monitoring · ✅ Guided setup (chat support)”. And a CTA button “Secure My Site Now” below that (another opportunity to convert). Possibly also mention if there’s a trial or money-back guarantee (not in spec, but if applicable). Ensure the pricing CTA scrolls or is visible on smaller screens (maybe repeat CTA at bottom as well).
 FAQ Section: Implement an FAQ accordion or list with the five Q&A pairs from microcopy. Mark them up with FAQPage structured data (each Q and acceptedAnswer). Ensure the text is exactly as provided, including the Q: and A: format (or styling them as question and answer visually). This addresses common user concerns, so make sure it’s easily accessible (maybe an anchor link to FAQ in top nav too).
 Footer & Trust: In the footer, include only necessary links: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service (if unique to AutoCertify, else noindex or minimally link them). Possibly a small note like “© 2025 AutoCertify”. If any cross-brand link is to be included, decide on one: maybe a small text like “Manage multiple websites? Check out DelegatedSSL.com” – but if we do, keep it one link, and likely add rel="nofollow" per the safety spec (to avoid any spam sibling detection). This is optional and should be weighed (maybe leave it out initially). Do not list all brands or anything like that.
 App Subdomain & Onboarding Wizard: The core of AutoCertify is the guided setup after clicking “Secure My Site Now”. This likely goes to an app subdomain (e.g., wizard.autocertify.net) where the user can sign up and follow steps. Implementation steps:
Host the app on wizard.autocertify.net (or similar) and ensure global noindex on it. This subdomain should serve the single-page app or pages for login, dashboard etc.
The sign-up form should collect Domain, Email, Password in one go (as spec hints at combined signup). Make sure the domain input automatically strips "https://" if they paste it (common mistake).
After sign-up, immediately take the user into the verification wizard in the app:
Show the “Action needed: one quick step” banner with a yellow background and 🟡 icon in the app UI.
Display the DNS record instructions. Use the exact texts from microcopy: “Add the record below. It’s safe and reversible.” above the record info. Present the Host/Value in a copyable form. Possibly detect domain registrar and show that AI widget: implement a mechanism to use domain WHOIS or known DNS to guess provider (maybe not trivial, but even a guess from domain name could suffice for big ones).
Provide the “Check Connection” button (with text exactly “Check Connection”). When clicked, call the backend to see if CNAME is present. Implement a short polling maybe (e.g., try a few times over 60 seconds if needed).
If no record found, show the error messages per microcopy:
If domain itself not found (rare at this point, since they provided domain already), but anyway the error “Hmm—can’t find that domain. Try without https://” could appear near the domain input (but domain is fixed now). Possibly skip this because our form already guided them not to include http.
If CNAME not detected, show “No worries—DNS can take a few minutes. Try again.”. This should be a friendly info message, not a scary error. Possibly also keep the banner but maybe add a sub-text “Still waiting for record...”.
Once the record is detected, proceed to obtain cert via backend ACME call. Meanwhile, show maybe a loading or intermediate message “Configuring your certificate...”.
Upon success, update the dashboard state: The banner becomes green with “Your Site is Secure.” and a big ✅ icon. Possibly show an animation or highlight.
The panel content can then change to a confirmation: maybe just a brief “✔ Domain verified and secured. Renewal will happen automatically going forward.” Or collapse the panel entirely and just show the secure banner.
Make sure the app triggers any appropriate backend to issue cert and install it (if site uses a proxy or if user has to download it? Likely AutoCertify is a fully managed proxy or ACME DNS responder service).
Throughout, ensure the chat support is accessible. If the user seems stuck (maybe after two failed checks), consider prompting “Chat with us, we can help you step-by-step.”
The app's navigation is minimal: likely just a simple header with AutoCertify logo and maybe a “Log out” or account email. Possibly no multi-section sidebar at all since it's one core flow. Keep it very simple to avoid confusion.
 Email Notifications: Implement back-end triggers for success/failure notifications if specified (not explicitly in spec, but likely helpful: e.g., send an email “Your site is now secure!” with instructions to verify the padlock; or if they sign up and don’t complete DNS in X time, maybe a reminder). Ensure any such emails match the brand tone (reassuring, encouraging).
 SEO & Analytics: For autocertify.net marketing pages, set unique <title> tags focusing on panic queries, e.g. “Fix Not Secure Website – Instant SSL Solution | AutoCertify” and meta descriptions reassuring a quick fix. Include <link rel="canonical" self-referencing. Add sitemap_autocertify.xml with these pages, and robots.txt allowing them and disallowing the wizard subdomain (the wizard subdomain should have its own noindex anyway). In robots.txt of autocertify.net, also explicitly disallow /wizard or any app paths if they exist on main domain. Make sure not to accidentally include any other brand references or links that could confuse (e.g., no mention of Keyless or Delegated in meta or content except maybe that one contextual link as discussed).
 Mobile Optimization & CWV: Given many small biz owners may be doing this from a phone or tablet, test the entire flow on mobile thoroughly. The sticky CTA bar should appear after hero on mobile (implement that: after scrolling ~100vh, show a fixed bottom bar with “Secure My Site Now” that on tap jumps to signup section). Ensure page speed is good: images optimized, minimal scripts. The wizard should also be mobile-friendly (fields large enough, etc. - we've set control min heights via tokens).
 No Mixed Content Issues: Since we’re dealing with HTTPS, ensure the site (including images like that browser bar image) is all loaded via HTTPS. The user coming with “Not Secure” might be on an HTTP site initially if they typed manually; enforce redirect to HTTPS on autocertify.net because we definitely want them on secure content while fixing their site, for trust.
 A11y & Focus: Even though user is non-tech, accessibility is still important. Focus outlines (green ring) should be visible for keyboard nav or high-contrast mode. Provide aria-live on status messages (e.g., when “Your site is secure” appears, screen readers are notified). The error messages “Hmm—can’t find domain” etc., should have role="alert" so they're announced. And the step instructions should have clear headings for screen reader users.
Once all these are checked and tested with a sample user or two (maybe have a non-tech person run through to see if they get confused anywhere), AutoCertify should deliver a seamless experience: user searches a fix, lands on a comforting page, quickly signs up, and within minutes has that padlock – with minimal frustration. If any step shows friction in testing, refine copy or add a tooltip as needed (this brand demands empathy-driven tweaks).
