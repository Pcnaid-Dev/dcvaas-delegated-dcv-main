AutoCertify SEO & Content Rules
AutoCertify.net’s content and SEO strategy is focused on capturing “panic search” queries and small business DIYers looking for quick SSL fixes, while keeping its site distinct from the other brands in topic and style. Key guidelines:
Topical Focus – Panic Fix & SMB Education
AutoCertify’s site must stay tightly on the topic of fixing “Not Secure” website issues and basic SSL guides for small business. This means we produce content around queries like “fix not secure site”, “secure my website”, “auto renew SSL”. The site can also host simple how-to guides for various platforms (e.g., “How to secure a Wix website” or “GoDaddy SSL not secure fix”) – but always oriented as troubleshooting or step-by-step fixes. Forbidden content: anything too developer-y (that’s KeylessSSL’s turf) or agency/multi-site management strategy (DelegatedSSL’s area). If something like 47-day cert lifetimes is covered, AutoCertify would frame it as “Browsers will soon require even more frequent updates – we handle this automatically for you”, which is a scare/solution angle for the SMB, as opposed to technical or operational detail. Basically, if a topic doesn’t align with an SMB owner’s immediate concern about site security and trust, it likely doesn’t belong. “SMB education” might include explaining what the “Not Secure” warning means, how SSL works in very high-level terms, etc., but always ending with the solution (AutoCertify). The SEO spec explicitly says AutoCertify content: “Not Secure” fixes, platform guides, wizards, SMB education only.
Unique Content – Avoid Overlap with Others
No page on AutoCertify should closely mirror one on KeylessSSL or DelegatedSSL. The branding, tone, and structure are already quite different (AutoCertify is very B2C-ish one-page style, others are B2B multi-section). We ensure:
Use the persona’s vocabulary distinctly: e.g., talk about “website builder” instead of “infrastructure” (Keyless) or “client domains” (Delegated). AutoCertify says “No coding required” whereas others never would. This natural divergence in wording helps search engines see it as separate.
Structure differences: AutoCertify’s homepage is a single long page addressing a specific funnel (with hero, benefits, steps, pricing, FAQ). Keyless’s has technical sections; Delegated’s has more corporate sections. That inherently lowers similarity. But we also avoid duplicating any full sentences or paragraphs from those sites. Even generic lines like “We handle the ACME challenge” would never appear on AutoCertify; instead it says “We verify everything for you.”
Shared topics: If something like “automatic renewal” is mentioned across brands, AutoCertify’s phrasing is unique: maybe “we keep watch 24/7 so you never have to worry about it again” vs. Delegated’s “stay green automatically” vs. Keyless’s “no cron jobs needed.” Each has its own spin.
Essentially, we follow the rule: “Every article must be written as if the other two brands do not exist.”. If AutoCertify has a blog called “Why HTTPS is important for your website,” it should not use the same outline or examples as, say, a technical KeylessSSL blog on HTTPS. It might instead use analogies (like “like putting a lock on your store’s door”). Also, if we do any platform-specific guides that overlap with KeylessSSL docs (like Keyless might have a doc “Using with Cloudflare” and AutoCertify might have “How to secure your Cloudflare site”), we must ensure AutoCertify’s is simpler, more tutorial-like with screenshots and non-technical narrative. Possibly, we also might choose to not put too many developer-centric platform guides on AutoCertify to avoid overlap entirely, leaving heavy stuff to Keyless docs.
Cross-Domain Linking Minimalism
AutoCertify should largely not mention DelegatedSSL or KeylessSSL on its site, since the user base is different. The SEO spec forbids sitewide cross-links, so no banners like “Are you an agency? Click here.” on every page. However, one contextual cross-link might be acceptable: for instance, on the FAQ or an “About” page, perhaps “Agencies and developers: we also offer advanced solutions (see DelegatedSSL for agencies, KeylessSSL for devs)”, but this would count as two cross-links which might be too many. More likely, we either have none, or maybe one subtle link on the homepage or support page. The example from spec: AutoCertify → DelegatedSSL “Manage this for clients?” could appear either after the primary content or as part of an FAQ like “Q: I manage multiple websites – A: If you manage sites for others, check out our DelegatedSSL... (with link).” That would abide by: only on relevant page, and just one link, anchor text matching the content (“manage multiple websites SSL for clients” etc.). Any cross-link we do include should be nofollow until we’re sure it's not hurting (the spec suggests adding rel=nofollow if we suspect poisoning). But initially, we can keep them normal as long as they are minimal.
Indexing & Site Structure Isolation
AutoCertify will follow the indexing architecture rules:
Its app (likely a wizard on a subdomain or maybe integrated? The spec suggests separate subdomains for app) should be on wizard.autocertify.net (as spec gave example). That wizard subdomain (or main app) will have a noindex directive on all pages because it's user-specific and maybe duplicate structure across many accounts. We'll generate robots.txt for that subdomain disallowing all, and X-Robots-Tag headers to double ensure no indexing.
The marketing pages (home, maybe blog or guides if any) are indexable. All those pages get self-canonical tags to autocertify.net host.
Choose canonical host: likely non-www as well (so autocertify.net). We'll 301 redirect www.autocertify.net to autocertify.net just like others.
autoCertify gets its own sitemap.xml listing the homepage, maybe a couple guides or FAQ pages (if not single-page site). And robots.txt for autocertify.net that allows crawling and points to its sitemap, and of course doesn’t list pages from other brands. We create separate GSC property for it as well.
Required Layout Differences
AutoCertify’s site template is by nature quite different:
It uses a single-column, step-by-step “wizard/diagnostic IA” approach on the marketing homepage itself (like a linear narrative). For example, there’s likely a section with a mock “Not Secure” browser image flipping to “Secure” (that’s a distinctive element others don’t have). It has large reassurance chips and a prominent chat widget because that’s on brand.
The SEO spec specifically says AutoCertify pages emphasize FAQPage/HowTo schema markup. So we should implement FAQPage schema for the FAQ section to target those Q&A queries. Possibly also HowTo schema for a guide like “How to fix Not Secure in Chrome” if relevant. This not only helps SEO but also differentiates content structure (the other brands might not use these schemas).
The page ordering is unique: hero, benefits, how-it-works, pricing, FAQ, support contact – none of which align section-by-section with Keyless or Delegated. This inherently helps avoid “similar neighbors” issues.
Additionally, AutoCertify’s visual design is different (friendly illustrations, green accents, etc.), which means underlying HTML is also quite different (for instance, Keyless had 10 bullet point brand summary on page; AutoCertify doesn’t; Delegated has heavy nav and table content; AutoCertify minimal nav). We further ensure difference by maybe having slightly different HTML structures for components (maybe AutoCertify uses more images or a different CSS grid vs the others using flex, etc.)
Content Rules – Brand-Specific Editorial
Vocabulary: AutoCertify uses words like “customers”, “visitors”, “sales”, “trust”, not “ACME”, “DNS API”, etc. It reads like a product for laypeople. Each article or section should reflect that vocabulary, which inherently separates it from the tech-speak on Keyless or the ops-speak on Delegated.
Approach shared topics carefully: e.g., all brands might mention “renewals happen automatically”. AutoCertify might phrase it as “We renew your certificate automatically so you’re always protected” – whereas Keyless would say “8x renewal velocity handled by us” (completely different phrasing). So maintain that style difference consistently.
Legal pages: We have either unique simplified Terms/Privacy for AutoCertify (with simpler language maybe), or if using a common one, mark them noindex or make slight brand references differences (the spec gave the option: make unique per brand or noindex duplicates). Unique is safer to avoid duplication signals, even if just replacing the brand name within them and adjusting tone slightly.
Performance & Isolation
One thing the SEO spec points out: ensure heavy load from one brand (like AutoCertify’s scanning) doesn’t affect others (CWV metrics etc.). That’s more infrastructure, but relevant: if AutoCertify has a “Check my site” free tool that gets hammered, ensure it’s cached or isolated so it doesn’t slow the site (which could hurt engagement metrics and indirectly SEO). We will also set up separate Search Console and analytics to monitor each brand individually for SEO. For AutoCertify, monitor queries like “not secure website fix”, CTRs, etc., and check that bounce rates are low (the site should immediately address their query and prompt engagement to fix it, which should yield good user signals). Finally, as with others, we’ll have an SEO QA: automated tests to ensure no cross-domain canonical or content issues slip in. E.g., ensure the homepage doesn’t accidentally use a common title or meta description that’s similar to others. We want something like “Not Secure Website – Instant Fix | AutoCertify” vs Keyless “API for SSL – KeylessSSL” etc. By following these rules, AutoCertify.net will remain a standalone, highly focused funnel for people searching basic SSL fixes, without getting entangled in duplication or topic dilution. It will rank for queries the other two intentionally avoid or wouldn’t rank well for, like “fix not secure warning” (which requires a consumer-friendly page). At the same time, it won’t risk penalization for overlapping content because its content angle is sufficiently divergent.
