AutoCertify App Dashboard & UI
AutoCertify’s dashboard is built for simplicity and hand-holding, given its users are often non-technical small business owners. It serves as both a status page and a guided wizard to fix the “Not Secure” issue.
Dashboard Layout
Upon logging in (or after sign-up), the user is greeted with a very streamlined dashboard, likely centered on their one (or few) domain(s). The top of the dashboard prominently features a status banner/card that immediately tells the user if their site is secure or not:
If the SSL is set up: a Big Green Secure Banner with a checkmark icon and the text “Your Site is Secure.”. This gives a clear all-good signal (green background or border, big font).
If not yet secure: a Warning Banner (yellow/orange tint) with a warning icon stating “🟡 Action needed: one quick step”. This is accompanied by a short instruction “Add the record below. It’s safe and reversible.” right beneath it, to reassure them that the fix won’t break anything.
Just below the banner (when action is needed) is the guided verification instruction panel. This panel is the heart of the onboarding in-app:
Guided Verification Panel (When Action Needed)
Step 1: “Add this DNS record”. The dashboard shows a box with the exact DNS record details the user must add. For example:
Host: _acme-challenge.yourdomain.com
Type: CNAME
Target: some unique subdomain (provided by the service, e.g. xxxx.autocertify.net)
But since the user might not understand those terms, the UI keeps it simple: It likely presents it as a single combined instruction or separate lines with “Copy” buttons next to each (host and target). Given the spec’s emphasis, it probably simplifies by saying something like “Add the following CNAME record in your DNS settings:” and shows something like yourdomain.com → (CNAME) → some.autocertify.net in a visual way. Each part might have a copy button. To further assist, the dashboard has a registrar picker or AI support widget that detects their DNS provider. For instance, a line on the panel or a chat popup says: “AI Support: I see you use GoDaddy. Click here for a step-by-step guide on adding your CNAME record.”. This is the AI help widget that provides provider-specific guidance if possible. Step 2: “I added it — Check now” (the wording in UI is “Check Connection”). This is a big primary button right under the DNS record instructions. Once the user believes they’ve added the record in their registrar, they come back and press this. When pressed, the app immediately attempts the DNS check (calls a backend that looks for the CNAME/TXT). While checking, the user might see a spinner or a note “Checking…” for a few seconds. If the check succeeds (record found), the app will proceed to finalize the certificate issuance and update the UI to the secure state (green banner). If it fails, two likely outcomes:
If the domain wasn’t found at all (common if they included “https://” or typed wrongly): The app might show a user-friendly error: “Hmm—can’t find that domain. Try without https://” . Possibly shown near the input if the domain entry was wrong.
If the DNS record isn’t there yet: It might show “No worries—DNS can take a few minutes. Try again.”, perhaps as a tooltip or message below the Check button. The spec explicitly lists these as error messages, so we’ll implement them.
Meanwhile, an info line “Changes can take a few minutes to show up. That’s normal.” is persistently shown in the instructions to set expectations that DNS propagation might delay the verification. Support CTA: If the user is stuck or the check fails repeatedly, a prominent “I’m stuck” link or button will open the chat support. The UI might have this right next to the Check button as a subtle text link, or the chatbot might proactively pop up if multiple failures are detected.
Post-Verification State
Once the CNAME is verified and the certificate is issued (which the backend likely handles automatically via ACME), the dashboard switches to the “Secure” state:
The banner at top turns green with “Your Site is Secure.”. Possibly an illustration of a lock or happy shield might accompany it.
The detailed panel might collapse or change to something like a confirmation message (maybe “Certificate active. Renewals will happen automatically.” for transparency). The UI likely simplifies to just showing the secure status and maybe a small note “Protected as of [date], renews automatically every 90 days.”
Additionally, the app might present a “Check Connection” button still, but now as a reassurance tool. In the spec, "Check Connection" is specifically the label for the verification button, but after success that button may disappear since there's nothing to check.
Domain List
For users with multiple sites (up to 50 on the plan), below the fold there is a list of domains in their account. It will show each domain with its status and a primary action:
If a domain is secure (green), it might say “Secure” and offer maybe a “View” or nothing.
If action needed (not verified), it likely has a “Check Connection” button or “Resume Setup”.
The table likely has just two or three columns on desktop: Domain, Status, Action. On mobile, these become cards stacking Domain + Status + a big action button (like “Fix” or “Check Now”).
AutoCertify’s design uses larger touch-friendly elements (min 44px height as per tokens) for these controls, expecting many users on mobile.
Add Domain Flow
During initial sign-up, AutoCertify inlines domain addition. If a user signs up via the marketing page, they likely already entered their domain in the sign-up form (that’s Step 1). If not, the dashboard would prompt “Add your website” first. This might be a modal or part of the dashboard if no domains exist. From the spec: “Keep it ‘one minute’ simple; can be modal to preserve momentum.”. The Add Domain form includes probably:
Website Address (Domain) – the user’s domain name (maybe pre-filled if they used the checker).
Email – which they provided at sign-up.
Password – possibly if sign-up and add domain are combined, else if they’ve signed in, no need to ask again. The spec mentions inline auth if possible.
So possibly at sign-up they collected domain/email/password in one go to streamline. After that, they drop right into the dashboard with that domain in “Action Needed” state. If a user wants to add another site (since plan allows 50), an Add Site button will be on the domain list. Clicking it might open the same modal to input another domain. That new domain would then show up with Action Needed steps to verify, one at a time.
Billing & Plan Info
AutoCertify’s app likely has a very minimal billing page or section (if any). Perhaps under a settings icon or profile menu, there’s “Subscription: Business Pro – Active”. They might integrate Stripe for billing, but given target, they may have chosen a simpler approach (like requiring credit card only after free trial or from start). The language around billing in-app (and on site) always emphasizes “peace of mind”, “monitoring”, “automatic renewals” rather than technical or monetary heavy terms. Likely in app, if they click on “Upgrade” (if that existed, but there's only one plan currently) or “Cancel”, it uses plain English: e.g., “Your subscription provides automatic renewal and monitoring for up to 50 sites. You can cancel anytime in this portal.” Keeping it comforting.
Notifications
AutoCertify might send email notifications (or maybe not, relying on the check by user). If so, the UI might have toggles like “Email me if something breaks” under a simple settings area. The spec hints at plain English in any settings: e.g., “Get alerts if something breaks.” if notifications exist.
Accessibility & Guidance
AutoCertify’s interface uses larger fonts (18px body on marketing, possibly slightly smaller in app but at least 16px) for readability. It avoids tiny text or technical jargon altogether. Focus states and keyboard nav still need to be good (focus ring is a green glow from tokens). Many users might not keyboard nav, but we cover it anyway. Also, colorblind users are considered: using icons plus color (checkmark vs warning icon) ensures red/green distinction isn’t solely by color. Tooltips and Banners: The “AI Support” message might appear as a little chat bubble or tooltip in the corner offering help. The error messages (domain not found, etc.) likely appear inline, maybe in a red text under the record or as a small banner. Chat Integration: There’s presumably a persistent chat icon (for 24/7 support) often bottom right. Possibly it glows or pops open with a suggestion during onboarding. In short, the AutoCertify dashboard acts as a friendly wizard: large text, clear icons, step-by-step prompts. It’s nearly impossible to get lost: the user is either looking at “Your site is secure” or a big yellow banner telling them exactly what to do with a single button to press after doing it. After that, the user can basically forget it (the app will rarely need visiting unless something goes wrong, in which case it will show an alert or email them).
