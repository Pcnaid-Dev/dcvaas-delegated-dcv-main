KeylessSSL App Dashboard & UI
Navigation & Information Architecture
The KeylessSSL app (portal) presents a streamlined, developer-focused interface. On desktop, a left sidebar navigation is used, featuring essential sections: Domains, Billing, and Settings (and API Tokens/Keys if applicable). Fewer sections are present compared to other brands – the emphasis is on domains and automation rather than multi-team management. The top bar provides context with environment/status indicators (e.g. rate limit status) and a user menu. On mobile, the sidebar collapses into a menu accessible via a hamburger icon or slide-over panel; a persistent “Add Domain” button remains visible on the Domains screen for quick access to the primary action.
Domains Dashboard Overview
Upon logging in, the Domains screen is the primary “dashboard.” It opens with a header line showing key metrics: “Active Domains | Pending Verification | Rate Limit Status” – giving developers at-a-glance status of their domain portfolio and any action needed. The main content is a table of domains, which is the “money screen” for this product. Table columns typically include: Domain, Delegation Status, Certificate Status, Next Renewal, Last Issuance, and Actions. This allows a quick scan of which domains are verified, which certificates are active, and if any renewals are upcoming. Each row in the Domains table is fairly dense but remains scannable. Domain names and DNS values are shown in a monospaced font for clarity (and to signal technical content). Rows use subtle hover highlights (e.g. a slight surface color lift) to indicate interactivity without distracting animation. The last column houses icon-only action buttons with tooltips – e.g. view details, rotate token, re-check DNS – giving power users quick controls. Bulk actions (if available in this brand) are minimal; KeylessSSL expects users to script automation via API for bulk operations, so the UI is optimized for individual domain troubleshooting rather than large-scale batch actions. Status indicators for each domain are shown as small pills or chips with a text label and colored dot. KeylessSSL uses a simple three-state system: Active/Verified (green), Pending (amber), Error (red). These chips are intentionally concise (1–2 words like “Active”, “Pending”, “Error”). Any detailed explanation of a failure or required action is accessible by expanding a domain’s detail view or via tooltip, rather than in the label itself. This keeps the dashboard clean and “at-a-glance,” fitting the “infra tool” vibe.
Domain Detail & Diagnostics
Clicking on a domain (or a “View” action) brings up a side panel or expandable section with detailed information and troubleshooting for that domain. This Domain Detail view includes: the exact delegation record that should exist (host and target) with copy-to-clipboard buttons, the current verification status with a “Re-check DNS” button if pending, the certificate status with last issuance and next scheduled renewal times, and a diagnostics area. Diagnostics present any failure modes (e.g. NXDOMAIN, wrong CNAME target, propagation delay) as bullet points if the domain is in an error state. This allows a developer to quickly identify why a domain might not be verifying or issuing (for example, “CAA policy prevents issuance” or “CNAME not found”). An Add Domain workflow is central to onboarding new domains. In KeylessSSL, adding a domain is done via a modal dialog for focus. The Add Domain Modal includes: an input field for the domain name (with a placeholder example like *.app.your-saas.com to indicate wildcard format), and an instruction text that reads “Add this CNAME record to your DNS provider once. We will handle rotations forever.”. When the user submits, the modal displays the exact DNS record to create:
Host: _acme-challenge.<your-domain>
Type: CNAME
Target: (the specific delegated target address provided by the system, e.g. xxx.dcv.keylessssl.dev)
These values are shown in a copy-friendly format, often with copy buttons next to each value for convenience. After adding the domain, the UI offers a “Verify DNS” button which triggers a DNS check (and possibly a short polling) to see if the CNAME delegation has been set up correctly. During this verification-in-progress state, the UI may indicate a pending status (e.g. a spinner or disabled state with “Verifying…” text). If verification times out, a helpful message appears (e.g. suggesting to double-check the record or wait for DNS propagation).
Tokens and API Integration
Given the developer audience, KeylessSSL’s dashboard also features an API Tokens/Keys page (often under Settings or a dedicated Tokens section). This page allows generating and managing API credentials. A crucial piece of UI copy here is the warning that new tokens are shown only once. For example, after clicking “Generate API Token,” the user is shown the token with a message like “Warning: This token is shown only once. It is stored hashed (SHA-256).”. The interface encourages immediate copying of the token (with a copy button and a confirmation toast “Copied.”). If the token is lost, the user must generate a new one (rotate tokens), which is aligned with security best practices.
Billing & Plans
In the Billing section, KeylessSSL keeps things simple. It likely displays the current plan (Hacker or Pro) and usage metrics (e.g. number of domains out of the free quota). KeylessSSL’s messaging in the app is straightforward about limits: for instance, free-tier users might see a note about rate limits or queue position. The language remains technical and blunt – highlighting things like “community queue” vs “priority queue”, presence of audit logs, etc., as applicable to the plan. Upgrade prompts (e.g. “Start Pro”) are present but low on marketing fluff; they focus on capabilities (more domains, team access) rather than emotive appeals.
Settings & Security
The Settings page provides basic profile/org controls, but notably includes links or sections for security-related information – consistent with the brand’s trust posture. Users can manage API keys (rotate/revoke), view audit logs if available (to track key usage or changes), and are given a prominent link to a Security page or documentation (since developers “buy threat models, not vibes”). The interface and copy reinforce that the platform is secure: references to scoped keys, the ability to rotate keys, and possibly 2FA or team roles are present or alluded to, matching the brand’s emphasis on security best practices.
Accessibility & UX Notes
KeylessSSL’s UI follows an “infrastructure tool” aesthetic, which means it favors clarity and keyboard-friendly design over flashy animations. All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs) show visible focus rings (using the brand’s focus style, a blue outline ring) when navigated via keyboard. Modals implement a focus trap and are escapable via the Escape key. Text contrast is high (light text on dark backgrounds) in accordance with WCAG AA guidelines for a dark theme. The design also respects prefers-reduced-motion; there are no gratuitous animations – only minimal hover and focus transitions for feedback. Tooltips have a dark theme to match the app, with subtle borders and shadows for readability. They are used sparingly to explain icons or abbreviations (e.g. a tooltip over a status chip might say “Pending CNAME – client action required”) but not for long paragraphs. Toast messages (small alerts at the bottom or top) confirm user actions like copying or saving with single words (“Copied.”, “Saved.”) so as not to interrupt the workflow. Overall, the KeylessSSL app dashboard is designed to feel like a serious, terminal-inspired tool – minimalistic, fast, and precise – aligning with developer expectations. All copy and layout choices serve to make SSL certificate automation feel like a straightforward part of a developer’s CI/CD pipeline rather than a cumbersome GUI.
