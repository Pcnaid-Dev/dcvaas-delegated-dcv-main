KeylessSSL Implementation Checklist
Developers and designers should use this checklist to ensure that KeylessSSL’s brand-specific requirements are properly implemented on the shared codebase. KeylessSSL.dev has a dark, technical theme and a developer-focused flow that must be respected.
 Brand Data Attribute: Implement a runtime check of the hostname to detect keylessssl.dev. On the marketing site and app, set the root element’s data-brand attribute to "keylessssl.dev". This triggers the KeylessSSL theme tokens and branding styles.
 Load Theme Tokens: Include the KeylessSSL CSS theme (variables) and ensure it’s scoped under :root[data-brand="keylessssl.dev"]. Remove any hardcoded colors in components – all colors, spacing, etc., should come from the theme token CSS. KeylessSSL’s dark mode and specific color palette must override the default. Verify that text and background contrast meets AA standards for the dark theme (light text on dark bg).
 Dark Mode & Contrast: Enforce that the UI uses a dark color scheme (the <meta name="color-scheme" content="dark"> or equivalent should be set) as KeylessSSL is dark-first. Double-check text (especially muted text) and link colors against backgrounds for sufficient contrast in dark mode.
 Focus Styles: Apply the global focus outline and ring styles from the theme to all interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields, table rows on focus, close icons, etc.). KeylessSSL uses a blue focus ring (--focus-ring / --focus-border in tokens) – ensure this appears when using keyboard navigation.
 Sticky Header Behavior (Marketing): The marketing site’s top navigation bar should be sticky and condense on scroll. The “Get API Key – Free for 3 Domains” CTA in the header should remain visibly prominent (do not shrink it into an icon, for example). On desktop, use centered nav links (Architecture, Integration, Pricing, Docs) as outlined in the spec. On mobile, ensure the menu collapses properly and the CTA is still accessible.
 Copy-to-Clipboard UX: Implement a proper copy-to-clipboard functionality for all code blocks and DNS record displays. When a user clicks a copy button (for a DNS record, API token, etc.), show a non-intrusive toast saying “Copied.”. Do not use alert popups. The toast should auto-dismiss. This applies to things like the delegation CNAME record, API token, etc..
 Integration Modal: Build the “View Integration” modal (triggered from the secondary CTA on the homepage). This modal should have tabs for code examples (cURL, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes). Ensure each tab shows a code snippet and that there’s a footer note in the modal saying “Tokens are scoped… shown once…” as a reminder (pulled from microcopy).
 API Key Generation UX: When the user signs up or generates an API key, follow the “shown only once” rule. After creation, mask or hide the token if the user navigates away or refreshes. Use the exact warning text provided: “Warning: This token is shown only once. It is hashed using SHA-256 before storage.” on the token generation page. This builds trust by showing we never store raw keys.
 Domain Status Chips: Implement the status chips on the Domains dashboard as described: pill-shaped, small text, with colored dot indicators. The chip labels for KeylessSSL are “Active”, “Pending”, “Error” (and maybe “Disabled” if applicable). Use the theme colors: green for Active, amber for Pending, red for Error. Ensure each has an appropriate tooltip or expandable detail for more info (e.g., “Pending – CNAME not detected” on hover).
 Verification Workflow: Create a one-record verification UX. On adding a domain, show exactly one CNAME record (as per spec) that the user needs to add. Provide a “Verify DNS” button that will poll the backend to check if the record is in place. If not verified within a timeout, display a clear message (e.g., “Still not verified. DNS changes can take a few minutes. We’ll keep checking.”) following the guidance for timeout messaging. The goal is to make this step “idiot-proof” – very clear what the user must do and what to expect.
 Rate Limit Visibility: Ensure that information about rate limits is visible in the dashboard header or an easily found location. KeylessSSL users care about when they might hit limits. The spec calls for surfacing “Rate Limit Status” in the header, which should be implemented as per design (e.g., an icon or text that when hovered or clicked explains current usage vs limit).
 Information Architecture Integrity: Do not remove or rename key sections unless conditional. The app should contain at least: Login page, Dashboard/Domains, Add Domain flow, Verification view, Billing, Settings. If the backend does not support something (e.g., Audit Log if not ready), it can be hidden; but do not arbitrarily change the flow. Keep the logical sequence the same as the shared platform.
 Marketing SEO Setup: On the marketing pages, set appropriate <title> tags and <meta description> that reflect KeylessSSL’s technical tone and keywords. For example, the homepage title might include “SSL Automation for Developers” or similar. Ensure the site has a sitemap.xml that only lists KeylessSSL pages, and a robots.txt that is correctly configured (allowing those pages, disallowing the app subdomain). Each page should have a self-referencing canonical link. Implementation note: These are typically done in the head HTML templates.
 Respect Reduced Motion: Audit the site for any heavy animations. KeylessSSL should use only subtle hover effects and no parallax or scrolling animations. If any template has large animated illustrations or autoplay videos (unlikely for this brand), remove or provide a static alternative. Also ensure any modals or popovers appear quickly (fast ease) without jarring effects, respecting users’ prefers-reduced-motion setting by minimizing even minor animations.
 No Functional Regressions: Confirm that introducing theming and brand-specific content does not break core platform functionality. KeylessSSL’s changes are mostly cosmetic and copy; they should not alter authentication, billing logic, certificate issuance processes, etc. Run regression tests to verify that all underlying API calls and workflows (sign-up, domain verification, certificate issuance, renewal, etc.) behave identically under the new UI skin. The spec explicitly says “theming + copy + layout only,” so any differences should be superficial.
Finally, perform a ruthless UX review (Vance Mercer check): Ensure nothing is ambiguous to the user. For KeylessSSL, that means: no placeholders or labels that could confuse (e.g., always use the exact CNAME target provided, do not hardcode example that might mislead); don’t over-promise (accurately reflect rate limits and capabilities); make the primary CTA (Get API Key) very prominent on marketing and unavoidable in the app until completed; and make the DNS verification step foolproof (clear instructions, obvious next step). If these are all checked off, the KeylessSSL implementation will be ready to ship as a developer-grade, high-trust product experience.
