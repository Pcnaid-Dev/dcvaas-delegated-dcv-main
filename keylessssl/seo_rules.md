KeylessSSL SEO & Content Rules
KeylessSSL.dev must maintain a tightly focused technical content profile online, to avoid SEO conflicts with the other brands and to appeal to its specific audience. Below are the SEO guidelines and requirements for KeylessSSL:
Topical Silo & Content Scope
KeylessSSL’s content should revolve around developer-centric SSL automation topics. This means ACME protocol, DNS-01 challenges, wildcard SSL automation, certificate APIs, DevOps security and similar themes. The site should not publish content outside this scope. For example: articles about general “SSL for beginners” or SMB-oriented guides belong on AutoCertify, not KeylessSSL. If a topic overlaps with another brand’s domain, KeylessSSL’s version must be written from a deeply technical angle so it truly becomes unique to the developer audience. Allowed content examples for KeylessSSL.dev:
“Using ACME DNS-01 in CI/CD pipelines”
“How to implement a custom LetsEncrypt client in Go”
“DNS Automation for Wildcard Certificates”
Disallowed or off-brand content:
“How to fix ‘Not Secure’ warnings for your website” (belongs to AutoCertify’s angle)
“White-label SSL management for clients” (belongs to DelegatedSSL’s angle)
In summary, if a topic doesn’t clearly fit the developer/API/security automation angle, it either needs to be reframed to that angle or not published on KeylessSSL.
Unique Content – No Duplicates Across Brands
Under no circumstances should KeylessSSL have pages that are mere duplicates of content on DelegatedSSL or AutoCertify. Each brand’s pages (homepage, features, pricing, docs, etc.) must be sufficiently differentiated in wording, structure, and intent so that search engines view them as distinct. We cannot copy-paste a page and just swap out the logo. For instance, all three brands might have a “How it Works” page about CNAME delegation, but each should be written from its persona’s perspective, with different examples and emphasis (developer vs agency vs SMB). If KeylessSSL covers a concept also covered on the other sites (e.g., 47-day cert lifetimes or CNAME delegation), its page should have a unique outline, different code samples or diagrams, and use developer jargon not present on the others. This avoids near-duplicate shingles that could cause Google to devalue or canonicalize pages together. All legal pages (Privacy, Terms) should ideally be customized for KeylessSSL; if they must be identical to other brands, mark them noindex to avoid duplication.
Cross-Domain Linking Policy
KeylessSSL can reference the other services only in a very limited, contextual way. For example, it’s acceptable to have a blog post that says, “Need to manage hundreds of client domains? Check out our agency solution.” with a link to DelegatedSSL.com. However, site-wide or repeated cross-links (like a footer "Our Brands" link list) are forbidden. Only link to another brand when it truly serves the user’s needs (contextual), and never more than one cross-brand link per page. The anchor text of such links should clearly describe the target (e.g., “SSL management for agencies” if linking to DelegatedSSL) to avoid any anchor mismatch penalties. There will be no reciprocal linking (KeylessSSL shouldn’t link to Delegated and vice versa on their homepages, for instance).
Indexing & Site Structure Isolation
The marketing site (keylessssl.dev) and the app/portal must be separated to prevent accidental indexing of app pages. The implementation must:
Host the user-facing app on a subdomain, e.g. app.keylessssl.dev (or similar, such as portal.keylessssl.dev).
Apply X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow (or meta noindex) on all pages of the app subdomain. The app is for logged-in use and duplicate across brands, so it must not appear in search results. KeylessSSL’s robots.txt should disallow crawling of the app subdomain entirely.
The marketing site (keylessssl.dev) will contain indexable pages like the homepage, pricing, docs, blog, etc. Each of these pages must include a self-referencing <link rel="canonical"> pointing to the keylessssl.dev URL of that page. Never use a canonical tag pointing at another domain.
Use a consistent host name style. KeylessSSL will choose non-www (i.e. https://keylessssl.dev) as the canonical site URL, and redirect any www.keylessssl.dev requests to the root domain.
KeylessSSL will have its own sitemap.xml listing only the keylessssl.dev pages. Similarly, its own robots.txt that allows search engines to crawl the marketing pages but likely excludes any internal API routes or dynamic endpoints. There should be no mixing of URLs from other brands in these files (each brand manages its sitemap/robots separately).
We will also set up separate Google Search Console profiles for keylessssl.dev (and its app subdomain, even if noindexed) to monitor indexing status in isolation.
Required Layout Differences
To avoid the “similar site” clustering by search engines, KeylessSSL’s site layout and structure will deliberately differ from DelegatedSSL and AutoCertify. For KeylessSSL, the required differences include:
Docs-First IA: KeylessSSL will heavily feature documentation and technical guides. It may have a sidebar navigation on the site, or a prominent Docs link (even in the top menu before “Pricing”). This signals a developer-focused information architecture.
Developer Schema Markup: Where applicable, use technical schema types like SoftwareApplication (for any CLI or tool references) or TechArticle for blog posts/tutorials. This is a subtle cue to search engines about the site’s tech focus.
Lean Visuals: Fewer glossy marketing banners, more code snippets and maybe architecture diagrams (think RFC-style line drawings as mentioned in the brand guide). This contrasts with, for example, AutoCertify which uses more step-by-step wizard graphics. The KeylessSSL pages might also have different ordering of sections (perhaps “How it Works” higher up, since developers care about that, and fewer or no customer testimonials).
By ensuring KeylessSSL’s page templates aren’t identical in structure to the other brands, we reduce the risk of Google seeing them as “near duplicates” even if content is rewritten. For example, the hero section might be arranged differently (with a code snippet or terminal screenshot on KeylessSSL vs a friendly image on AutoCertify). KeylessSSL might use a dark theme on its site vs a light theme on others – this also naturally leads to different HTML/CSS structures and content.
Write for the Developer Persona
All content on KeylessSSL should use developer-centric language. This isn’t just good for users, but also for SEO differentiation. Use jargon and acronyms that developers search for: e.g., “ACME DNS challenge,” “certbot alternative,” “automate Let’s Encrypt wildcard”. These are keywords that align with KeylessSSL’s purpose. Avoid generic or high-level phrasing that might appear on AutoCertify or DelegatedSSL. For instance, where AutoCertify might say “No coding required,” KeylessSSL content would never use that phrase – in fact, coding is expected. Such differences in wording will naturally reinforce the separation between the sites in search indices. In summary, KeylessSSL’s SEO strategy is to be laser-focused on tech. By strictly siloing content to developer topics, enforcing unique writing and layouts, and carefully isolating the site’s technical structure (noindexing shared components), KeylessSSL.dev will rank for the queries that matter (e.g. “SSL API,” “certbot automation”) without tripping duplication filters with its sister sites. The end result should be a site that Google sees as an authoritative developer resource in the SSL automation niche, completely distinct from the business or SMB-oriented content of the other brands.
