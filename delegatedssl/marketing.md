DelegatedSSL Marketing Site
Hero Section (Above the Fold)
Headline: “The Set‑and‑Forget SSL Dashboard for Agencies”. This tagline immediately communicates the core benefit to the target persona (digital agencies, MSPs): a hands-off, automated SSL management solution.
Subheadline: “Manage 1,000+ client domains in one place. Stop the 3 AM ‘Certificate Expired’ calls with automated renewals, clear status alerts, and a workflow your team can run in minutes.”. This copy stresses scalability (managing thousands of domains), relief from panic incidents, and operational efficiency – all key pain points for agencies.
Primary CTA: Start Your Agency Trial – a bold call to action inviting agencies to try the service (often a 14-day or 30-day trial specific to agencies).
Secondary CTA: Schedule a Demo – for higher-touch prospects (enterprise or those who want to see it in action before committing).
Trust Assurances: Below the CTAs, a small line reads “No credit card. 10‑minute setup. Cancel anytime.” to lower friction for trials. The hero background might include an abstract dashboard screenshot or “green light” imagery indicating everything is in good order (since the product motif is “All Green = All Good.”). If used, it will be subtle and professional. The emphasis in design remains on the headline and CTAs.
Pain & Relief Section (“Stop SSL from becoming a support burden”)
Immediately following the hero, DelegatedSSL addresses the agency pain point: broken or expired certificates causing support emergencies. A section with headline “Stop SSL from becoming a support burden.” encapsulates this. It lists three bullet points in business terms:
Reduce tickets: Fewer “site down” panics and emergency support calls. This assures agencies that adopting DelegatedSSL will cut down their customer support load.
Save time: A single place to monitor all renewals and client preparedness – no more jumping between registrar accounts or spreadsheets to see which cert expires next.
Scale cleanly: Add more client sites without adding chaos or surprise costs. Implies that whether they onboard 10 or 100 new client domains, the process remains manageable and predictable.
A small before/after visual may accompany these bullets: e.g., Before: a tangle of multiple SSL sources (panels, spreadsheets) vs. After: one DelegatedSSL dashboard mostly full of green status indicators. This visual drives home the transformation in operations.
Core Features (Three-Column Highlights)
The page then showcases three core pillars of the solution (often in a three-column layout with an icon and text for each):
Stop Certificate Sprawl – “Unified dashboard for every client domain.” Explanation: agencies have domains spread across GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc. DelegatedSSL provides one place to see them all, with search and filters across the entire portfolio. (Icon idea: a grid of domain names or stacked papers symbolizing consolidation.)
Protect Your Margins – “Flat pricing that scales with your business.” Explanation: Unlike competitors that charge per domain (eroding profit as you add clients), DelegatedSSL’s flat-rate plan means agencies can resell or bundle SSL management profitably. This likely references the $79 flat fee covering up to 250 domains, encouraging agencies to mark it up per client. (Icon: a shield with a dollar sign or an upward graph indicating profit.)
100% White Label – “Your brand stays front and center.” Explanation: All client-facing elements (verification instructions, status pages, emails) carry the agency’s branding, not DelegatedSSL’s. This reassures that using the service won’t confuse the agency’s clients; instead it enhances the agency’s own service offering. (Icon: a certificate or badge with an editable label, symbolizing branding control.)
Each feature blurb is 2-3 sentences, focusing on the benefit to the agency: operational clarity, predictable costs, and client transparency.
Product Story: “One dashboard. One standard. All green.”
Next is a narrative section highlighting how DelegatedSSL feels to use. The headline “One dashboard. One standard. All green.” is used to tie together the story. The paragraph explains that DelegatedSSL gives the team a single, standardized view where everything is either green (okay) or flagged if action is needed. It likely notes that administrators can quickly identify what’s active, what needs client action (e.g., pending verification), and what’s blocked (e.g., by a CAA record) – “before it becomes a fire drill.”. This copy underscores reliability and proactivity, aligning with the persona who values avoiding crises. There may be an annotated dashboard image here: callouts highlighting features like:
“Expiring Soon” filter (to show upcoming expirations).
“Action Needed” queue (domains waiting on client input).
Bulk actions (e.g., send reminders, export reports).
Audit Log (track who did what).
These annotations directly connect to the UI capabilities that matter to an operations team.
“How it Works” Workflow Section
A step-by-step horizontal timeline (or vertical on mobile) outlines how an agency would deploy DelegatedSSL. The headline might say “Set it up once. Run it like a service.”. The steps are:
Connect your organization – Sign up, add team members, and choose a plan (the Agency trial or Enterprise plan). Essentially, onboarding the agency’s account.
Add domains in bulk – Import client domains, either via CSV upload or an admin UI, grouping them by client if needed. DelegatedSSL supports bulk onboarding since agencies might start with hundreds of domains.
Send white-labeled verification – With one click, send each client a link or instructions to add the necessary CNAME. The copy: “Clients get a clean link on your domain with simple DNS instructions.” emphasizes the white-label aspect (their clients see the agency’s custom portal domain, e.g., certs.agencyname.com).
Stay green automatically – Once domains are verified, DelegatedSSL auto-issues and auto-renews certificates indefinitely. “...your team focuses on higher-margin work.” is the supporting line, showing that after initial setup, there’s little ongoing effort.
This section visually assures that the process is straightforward and time-limited (one-time setup for continuous benefit). It might use simple illustrations for each step (e.g., step 1: team icon; step 2: upload list icon; step 3: email or link icon; step 4: green check or clock showing automation).
Testimonials / Proof Points
To build trust, a block may present an operational outcome testimonial. For instance, a quote from a fictitious or anonymized agency owner: “DelegatedSSL saved us from 5+ outage calls a month. Now it’s just all green lights.” along with a metric like “75% reduction in SSL-related support tickets”. Since this is early-stage, actual names might be placeholders (with a note “swap real names later” in the spec), but including one or two testimonial cards adds credibility. The focus is on reliability and margin improvement.
Pricing Section
DelegatedSSL’s pricing is highlighted with the tagline “Flat-rate plans built for agencies.”. Two plan cards are shown (Agency & Enterprise):
Agency Plan – $79/month: supports up to 250 domains (flat rate). The card bullet points likely mirror what’s in the marketing copy: Unified dashboard, White-label portal, Team access & roles, Status monitoring & renewals, etc. (These features correspond to solving sprawl, branding, multi-user, and reliability). The CTA on this card is “Start Your Agency Trial”, encouraging sign-up.
Enterprise Plan – $299/month: for 2000+ domains, includes an SLA and priority support. Bullet points might say “Everything in Agency” plus higher capacity, SLA, advanced reporting, etc.. The CTA is “Schedule a Demo”, catering to those larger clients who expect a conversation.
Beneath the pricing cards, a prompt reads: “Need custom limits, multi-org, or special workflows? Talk to Sales.”. This invites any out-of-band deals or use cases to contact directly, ensuring even edge prospects have a path. The pricing section underscores that DelegatedSSL doesn’t nickel-and-dime per certificate – a huge selling point versus competitors.
FAQ Section
Given agencies have specific concerns, a concise FAQ addresses top questions:
“What is delegated validation?” – Explains in simple terms how the CNAME mechanism works, emphasizing it’s a one-time setup per domain (so clients won’t constantly need to update DNS).
“Is it truly white-label?” – Answers that yes, clients see only the agency’s branding/domain throughout the process. Possibly mentions the custom portal domain and email white-labeling in the Enterprise plan.
“What if a client’s DNS has issues (CAA blocks)?” – Explains the “Blocked/CAA” scenario: DelegatedSSL detects it and provides a fix workflow (like instructions to update CAA or an option to override via the interface).
“How does this save me money?” – Reinforces the profit center argument: agencies can resell this as a service (charging each client, while paying a flat fee).
“Can I use this for SaaS custom domains?” – Many agencies also operate SaaS platforms. The answer would be yes: DelegatedSSL supports multi-tenant SaaS use cases (this ties into keywords like “saas custom domains”).
Each FAQ answer remains concise (1-3 sentences) and positive. The spec noted some questions were added in the marketing doc with instruction to keep answers short.
Footer
The footer includes standard links grouped by relevance: Product (Features, Pricing, How It Works), Resources (Docs, Guides, Security, FAQ), Company (Contact, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy). Notably, it will not include links to the other brand sites (per SEO rules, no “family” cross-links). It may, however, have a subtle mention like “© 2025 DelegatedSSL” and possibly the parent company name if applicable.
