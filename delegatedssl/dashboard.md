DelegatedSSL App Dashboard & UI
Overview Dashboard (Organization Summary)
When an agency user logs into DelegatedSSL, they land on an Overview or Organization Dashboard screen that gives a high-level summary of their account’s SSL status. This overview typically features KPI cards and a priority list: for example, a card showing “15 / 20 Seats Used” for team seats and another showing “450 / 500 Domains Active” to indicate domain usage versus plan limit. These numbers immediately tell the admin how much capacity they’re using. There is also a quick indicator of overall health: if everything is fine, a message might state “No urgent issues. You’re green.”; if not, it might say “3 domains need client verification to go live.” as an alert at the top. A standout element on the Overview is “Today’s Priority Queue” – essentially a list of any domains needing attention, sorted by urgency (e.g., expired or blocking issues in red first, then pending verifications in yellow). This ensures that first thing each day, the ops team knows what to tackle. For example: “2 domains expiring in <7 days (Action Required)” might appear in red, whereas “5 domains pending client CNAME” in yellow.
Navigation & IA
DelegatedSSL’s app interface is more complex than KeylessSSL’s to accommodate multi-tenant management. The left sidebar (which can collapse) contains sections such as: Overview, Domains, Clients, Verification Links, Reports, Team & Roles, White Label, Billing, Audit Log, Settings, Support. Not all sections may be active from day one (some might be placeholders if not fully implemented), but they’re included to mirror agency needs. For example, Clients could list client organizations or tags, Verification Links might provide a quick way to resend or check status on pending client actions, Reports for exportable summaries, etc. The top bar complements this with an organization switcher (if an agency manages multiple sub-organizations), a global search bar (to find a specific domain or client quickly), notifications (certificate expiring warnings, etc.), and the user profile menu. Active navigation states are indicated by a highlighted background on the sidebar item and a left border in the primary brand color (blue). Importantly, DelegatedSSL avoids using the success-green color for nav highlights, to not confuse navigation selection with a “good status” indicator.
Domains Screen (Flagship UI)
The Domains section is the core operational interface – essentially a table of all domains under management. It includes robust features:
Search and Filters: A search bar at the top with placeholder “Search domains, clients…” allows filtering by domain name or client name. Filters might include status filters (Active/Action Needed/Blocked), client filters, etc. There’s also a bulk select (checkboxes) for multi-domain actions.
Table Layout: The domains table uses a sticky header (so column labels stay visible when scrolling). Header row is styled with a light background (--color-surface-2) and muted text. Columns likely include: Domain, Client (owner), Status, Last Renewal, Next Expiration, and Actions. The status column shows a colored icon+label (“Active”, “Action Needed”, “Blocked”, etc.) as described below.
Row Hover & Selection: On hover, a row is highlighted with a slight blue tint (--table-row-hover-bg). If a row is selected (for bulk action), it might use a slightly stronger highlight (--table-row-selected-bg). Bulk actions (appearing when multiple rows selected) could allow: “Send verification link” (for multiple pending domains), “Export CSV”, “Assign owner/client”, or “Add tag”. If any of those actions are available, a secondary toolbar appears above the table when items are checked.
Inline Actions: Each row likely has an Actions menu (a “kebab” ⋮ icon). DelegatedSSL’s spec emphasizes that no icon-only action should lack a tooltip and aria-label – accessibility is considered. The common per-domain actions include: View Details, Resend Verification (if pending), Force Renewal, Revoke/Disable, etc., with confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.
Row Expansion: DelegatedSSL supports expanding a domain row to see more without leaving the page. This may show info like the issuing CA, certificate coverage (SANs), a quick link to the client verification portal for that domain, last error message if any, and a “Send reminder” button if Action Needed. This allows ops teams to handle many issues from one screen.
Status Indicators (Traffic-Light System)
DelegatedSSL uses a more elaborate status labeling than KeylessSSL, reflecting an ops dashboard ethos. The statuses and their display:
Active – shown with a green check mark icon (or dot) and label “Active”. Subtext (in tooltips or detail) might say “Auto‑renewing”. This means the domain is verified and certificates are issuing/renewing normally.
Action Needed – shown with an amber ⚠️ icon and label “Action Needed”. Tooltip could read “Pending CNAME (Client action required)”. This indicates the domain is waiting on client DNS verification. The UI likely surfaces a one-click option to resend the verification instructions to the client.
Blocked – shown with a red ❌ icon and label “Blocked”. Tooltip example: “CAA policy prevents issuance”. This means issuance failed due to a DNS CAA record or similar policy. The UI might include a “Click to Fix” link in the tooltip or detail that opens a guide on how to resolve (or triggers an email to the client if it’s on their side).
Pending – shown with a neutral hourglass ⏳ icon and label “Pending” (gray or neutral color). Indicates a domain recently added or a certificate in provisioning (no action needed, just in progress). Subtext: “Provisioning in progress”.
These chips are all pill-shaped with a small icon and text. DelegatedSSL’s spec insists that status should “never be color-only” – always include icon+text+tooltip for clarity. In the app, they might also be used as filters (clicking a status chip could filter the domains list by that status).
Client Verification Workflow
A core unique feature is the Client Verification Portal, which is white-labeled. From the agency’s perspective (inside DelegatedSSL app), when they add a new client domain, two things happen:
In DelegatedSSL app (internal view): The domain shows up as “Action Needed” with instructions the agency can view – essentially a two-column panel with what the client needs to do. It likely has a copy of the DNS record and a “Send Verification” button or link they can copy. The agency user can copy the link to send via their own email or click a button to have the system send it.
In the Client’s view (portal): The client gets a link to a page on the agency’s custom subdomain (e.g., https://ssl.youragency.com/verify/XYZ). This page uses the agency’s logo and colors (set in White Label settings). It has a simple wizard:
Header: Agency logo + title “Secure Domain Setup”.
Step 1: “Add this DNS record” – it displays the CNAME (host and target) with copy buttons.
Step 2: “Click Verify” – a big button for the client to click once they’ve added the DNS record.
Confirmation: After clicking verify and the system seeing the CNAME, a message “You’re secured. No further action needed.” appears along with a green check icon.
Helper text: e.g., “If you don’t manage DNS, forward this page to whoever does. This takes 2 minutes.” to encourage delegation if necessary.
This portal is intentionally one-job-per-page: it doesn’t confuse the client with extra info – just tells them exactly what to paste and what to click. It’s designed to minimize support calls from clients; even non-technical clients can follow two steps.
Within DelegatedSSL, once the client completes verification, the domain’s status flips to Active (green), and perhaps a toast or notification informs the agency user that the client domain “Example.com is now verified and secure.”
Team Management and White Label Settings
DelegatedSSL includes a Team & Roles section. Here the agency can invite team members and assign roles like Owner, Admin, Operator, Read-only. The UI shows seat usage (e.g., “15 of 20 seats used”). Admins can invite new users via email and set permissions. This ties into why the product highlights “team access” as a feature. The interface likely lists team members and their roles, with options to revoke or change roles. Under White Label settings, the agency can upload their logo, pick a primary color (which will reflect in their client portal’s accent color – default is DelegatedSSL’s blue until changed), and set up their custom domain for the client portal (e.g., CNAME certs.theiragency.com to DelegatedSSL). The app would show whether the custom portal domain is active (DNS and SSL configured) or if setup steps remain (this might tie into a DNS verification for the custom domain itself). They can also customize client-facing email templates (like the verification email text) and send a test email to themselves. The Audit Log section provides a table of events (e.g., “John Doe added domain example.com”, “SSL issued for example.com”, “Jane Smith updated White Label settings”). This is important for MSPs to have accountability. It’s filterable by event type or user.
Billing Page
In the app’s Billing section, agencies see their current plan (Agency or Enterprise), usage versus limits, and upgrade options. The interface shows, for example, a progress bar for domain usage (450/500 domains used) and a summary of seat usage. If they approach limits, messages encourage upgrading (e.g., “Near domain limit – consider Enterprise plan”). The two plans are outlined similarly to the marketing site but in brief: Agency (with a Manage Subscription or Upgrade button if on trial), Enterprise (with a “Contact Sales” or similar if on Agency). A note might say “Need custom limits or multi-org? Contact us.”.
Support & Integration
A Support section in the sidebar likely just provides links: maybe a direct link to documentation, an email (or chat widget) for support, or a form to submit a ticket. It might not be a full page but rather an external link. Integration-wise, DelegatedSSL might eventually have API/Webhooks. If an API section exists (similar to KeylessSSL’s token section), it would be branded similarly but with possibly multiple API keys (for different team members or sub-clients). The UI elements (generate token, show once) would be similar to KeylessSSL’s approach, but toned for an ops audience.
Accessibility and UX Considerations
DelegatedSSL’s app, being enterprise-leaning, adheres to accessibility and thorough UX:
Keyboard Navigation: All interactive components (sidebar items, table rows, buttons in modals) are reachable via Tab and have clear focus states (the focus ring is a blue outline by default, with a thicker variant for danger items).
Modals: Used for confirmations (like “Are you sure you want to remove this domain?”) and forms (like “Add Domains” bulk import). They use the overlay variable for backdrop (--overlay semi-dark), a white surface, rounded corners, and drop shadow (--shadow-lg). They trap focus and close on Esc, abiding by a11y guidelines. Enter key submits if a primary action is present.
No “dangerous” actions without confirm: The spec notes “never destructive without confirm” for destructive buttons. So if the user tries to delete or disable something, a modal asks them to confirm.
Tooltips: Provided on all icon buttons and truncated text. They appear on focus (for keyboard users) as well as hover, and are styled with dark background and white text (the default for the theme).
Responsive Design: The sidebar collapses on smaller screens, switching to a top-bar menu. Tables on mobile become cards: each domain might show as a card with the domain, status chip, and a primary action (like “Send Link” if pending, or menu for more). The design ensures even on a phone, an agency user could check statuses and trigger key actions without needing horizontal scroll.
By implementing these UI details, DelegatedSSL’s dashboard feels like a serious ops console that still carries an agency-friendly polish (e.g., somewhat larger font for readability, slightly more padding than a pure dev tool). It conveys calm control – lots of green lights, and clear next steps for any yellows/reds – exactly what the marketing promises (a set-and-forget experience where chaos is reduced to a manageable system).
