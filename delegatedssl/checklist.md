DelegatedSSL Implementation Checklist
This checklist enumerates the must-dos to implement DelegatedSSL.com and its app variant correctly. DelegatedSSL has a distinct brand identity (trust blue theme, enterprise feel) and feature set tailored for agencies. Before launch, ensure all the following are checked:
 Hostname & Branding Init: Add logic to detect when the site/app is accessed via delegatedssl.com (or its app subdomain). Set document.documentElement.dataset.brand = "delegatedssl.com" accordingly at the earliest point (before app render). This will load DelegatedSSL’s theme tokens and ensure components know which copy to use.
 Include DelegatedSSL Theme Tokens: Load the DelegatedSSL CSS variables (preferably via one global CSS file) scoped under :root[data-brand="delegatedssl.com"]. Make sure all shared components reference these tokens (no fallback to Keyless styles). Check that primary and accent colors (blue and teal) meet contrast requirements on both light backgrounds and colored surfaces (like buttons) – adjust if needed for WCAG compliance.
 Map Legacy Tokens: If the codebase has any old token names or inline styles, map or replace them with DelegatedSSL’s provided aliases (--primary, --border, etc.) to avoid missing styles. This prevents regressions where, say, a component expects --color-primary but DelegatedSSL theme uses --color-primary-500. The provided alias section in tokens should cover common cases.
 Enforce High Contrast & A11y: DelegatedSSL’s palette is light, but ensure text (especially blue text on light backgrounds or teal accents) passes contrast checks. Buttons and links should be clearly visible. Use the --focus-ring style for focus outlines (blue glow) on all focusable elements. Keyboard navigation must reveal the focused item (e.g., focused sidebar item gets focus-ring or similar).
 Implement Status Indicators: The app needs to show statuses as per “traffic light” spec. Use dot icons + labels for Active, Action Needed, Blocked, Pending on domain rows. Connect these to actual system states (e.g., map ACME status or domain verification state to these labels). Tooltips for Action Needed and Blocked must use the exact phrasing: “Pending CNAME (Client action required)” and “CAA Error (Client DNS blocks Let’s Encrypt - Click to Fix)”. These can be set in a localization file or directly as title attributes for now.
 Bulk Actions & Table Features: Ensure the Domains table supports: sticky headers, row hover highlight (--table-row-hover-bg), multi-select checkboxes, and a bulk action toolbar when selections are made. Bulk actions should at least include “Send verification link” and “Export CSV” as per spec. (If backend for bulk import or bulk assign isn’t ready, those UI elements can be disabled or hidden.)
 Overview Dashboard Widgets: Build the Overview page with KPI cards and queue as described. Two cards: Domains Active and Seats Used with numeric progress (e.g., “450/500 Domains Active”, “15/20 Seats Used”). And a “Priority Queue” list for urgent issues: implement logic to list domains that are in Blocked (red) or Action Needed (yellow) state, sorted by severity (all reds then all yellows). If no issues, show the green “No urgent issues” message. This overview should update or refresh periodically (or on page load at minimum).
 Client Verification Portal Flow: Set up the white-labeled client verification page mechanism. This involves:
Generating unique verification links (likely on app subdomain or a CNAME domain) for each pending domain.
Internal Panel: In the app’s Domains detail or a dedicated “Verification” section, show the two-column instructions (Step 1 DNS record, Step 2 verify) for agency users.
External Portal: Create a standalone page/template for clients (unauthenticated) that reads the token from URL and displays the verification steps with the agency’s branding. Use the agency’s custom domain if configured (delegated via CNAME to our system). The page should exactly say: “Secure Domain Setup” as title, “Add this DNS record” and “Click Verify” for steps, and upon success “You’re secured. No further action needed.”. Also include the helper text about forwarding the page if the viewer isn’t the DNS manager.
Make sure once the client clicks Verify and the backend confirms the DNS, it triggers our backend to mark domain verified. Also ensure the link either expires or shows a “Already verified” message if reused.
 White Label Customization: Hook up the White Label settings in the app. The admin must be able to: upload a logo (store it and display on client portal pages), set a primary color (could be as simple as entering a hex code or picking from a palette). That color should override --color-primary-500 in the client portal context to skin the portal to the agency’s brand (if supported; if not, at least use their logo). Provide instructions or a field for setting up a custom portal domain (e.g., instruct them to CNAME certs.theiragency.com to portal.delegatedssl.com) and show status if that’s verified. If email templates are editable, ensure a simple editor or placeholders.
 Roles & Access Control: Implement the Team & Roles management UI. List users, their role, and seat count. Provide ability to invite users (if backend API exists) by email with a default role. Roles: Owner (full access), Admin (manage domains/teams but perhaps not billing?), Operator (manage domains but not team?), Read-only (viewing rights). Ensure that certain actions (like changing billing, editing white-label settings) are restricted to Owner/Admin in UI if applicable. If the backend doesn’t enforce yet, the UI should still reflect intended permissions (e.g., gray out delete buttons for read-only users).
 Audit Log: If the backend provides audit log data, surface it in the UI under Settings or a dedicated Audit Log section. Filter or search as needed. If not fully implemented, have a placeholder or note “Coming soon” to avoid dead ends.
 Responsive Behavior: Test the UI on various screen sizes. On small screens, ensure the sidebar collapses to a hamburger menu properly. The Domain table should turn into stacked cards per entry: implement that per spec – each domain card showing key info and an action button for the primary action (e.g., if pending, a “Send Link” or “Verify” button). The overview KPI cards might collapse into a single column list. Make sure the top-bar menus (profile, notifications) work on mobile (maybe they become part of the hamburger menu or show as icons).
 Modal Accessibility: As global practice, ensure modals (e.g., Add Domain, Confirm Delete) trap focus and have aria-modal and appropriate labels. Specifically check: Enter key submits the primary action by default, Esc closes the modal (should already but verify). The “Schedule a Demo” form (if any) should be accessible too.
 SEO Metadata & Indexing: For the marketing site pages (home, features, pricing, etc.), set unique <title> and <meta description> tags focusing on agency keywords (e.g., “White-Label SSL for Agencies | DelegatedSSL”). Ensure each page has <link rel="canonical" href="https://delegatedssl.com/that-page">. Create sitemap_delegatedssl.xml listing all public pages and add it to robots.txt. Also, important: verify no accidental indexation of the app – e.g., the login page should have noindex since it's not meant to rank, and definitely the portal subdomain should send X-Robots-Tag: noindex headers globally.
 Cross-link Check: Ensure there are no “family site” links in header or footer. DelegatedSSL should not, for example, have a footer saying “KeylessSSL | DelegatedSSL | AutoCertify” – the spec forbids that. If product comparisons or mentions exist, they should be in context (as discussed, maybe a single-line in FAQ). So double-check navigation and templates for any inadvertent links or references to the other brands. Each brand must stand alone in the eyes of search engines.
 Pre-Launch SEO Test: Run an SEO smoke test for DelegatedSSL: for each primary page on delegatedssl.com, fetch as Google or use a tool to ensure: status 200 OK, correct title, description, canonical self, no stray noindex on them, and that robots.txt allows crawling those pages. Also check that the app subdomain returns noindex (e.g., hit the dashboard route as a non-auth user and see the header). After launch, monitor Search Console for any duplication issues or index coverage problems specifically for delegatedssl.com.
 Post-Launch Conversion QA: Since DelegatedSSL is about conversion (trials, demos), ensure all CTAs work: the “Start Agency Trial” button goes to the correct signup flow (likely a registration page specific to agencies or the same signup but tagged as agency), and “Schedule a Demo” triggers the intended action (either opens a form modal or links to a booking page). Test that the trial signup actually provisions a DelegatedSSL tenant (with branding and limits) – this might be backend config but make sure UI passes the right parameters (like brand=delegatedssl so the user gets the right experience).
Finally, do a UX review with an agency use-case in mind: simulate adding a bunch of domains, sending a verification, etc., to confirm the UI and copy make sense. The spec’s final note from Vance: “keep the CTA discipline (one primary CTA: Start Your Agency Trial) and make the Domains table feel like the money screen every time it loads” – so verify the homepage only really pushes one main action, and the domains table indeed highlights important info (probably by default sorting to show any issues at top via the queue or color). If all the above are checked off, DelegatedSSL should deliver a polished, brand-consistent experience for agency users.
