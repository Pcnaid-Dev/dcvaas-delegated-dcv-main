DelegatedSSL SEO & Content Rules
DelegatedSSL.com’s online presence must be carefully managed to cater to its agency/MSP audience and to remain distinct from the other brands. The SEO strategy ensures DelegatedSSL positions itself around client SSL management and white-label service topics, and avoids crossover duplication with KeylessSSL or AutoCertify.
Topical Focus and Silo
DelegatedSSL’s content should squarely focus on reseller, multi-domain management, and white-label SSL solutions. This means blog posts, documentation, and marketing pages revolve around themes like: managing SSL for clients at scale, handling SSL in a web agency context, white-label integrations, and operational efficiencies (alerts, reporting, compliance). Permitted content topics on DelegatedSSL:
White-label SSL management techniques and benefits.
Multi-tenant custom domain SSL (e.g., “How to manage custom domains for your SaaS customers”).
Operational guides for avoiding certificate expiry incidents (targeting queries like “manage client SSL certificates”).
Case studies of agencies implementing automated SSL for their clients.
Topics to exclude or redirect: developer-centric ACME how-tos (those belong to KeylessSSL), or very simple “what is SSL” explainer content (if any, that’s more AutoCertify’s realm, but likely none should appear there either). If a certain subject overlaps (e.g., 47-day renewal policies), DelegatedSSL’s handling should be in the context of operational impact for agencies rather than the technical deep-dive (Keyless) or the panic fix (AutoCertify).
Differentiation from Other Brands (No Duplicate Pages)
Every page on DelegatedSSL.com must be unique in copy and structure compared to KeylessSSL.dev and AutoCertify.net. We cannot have a “Features” page that is just a re-skinned copy of KeylessSSL’s features page, for instance. The structure and tone should differ: DelegatedSSL might structure features around business outcomes (Profit, Efficiency, Reliability), whereas KeylessSSL might structure by technical pillars, etc. This inherently changes headings and flow, aiding uniqueness. If covering a shared concept, approach it from DelegatedSSL’s angle. For example, a blog on “90-day vs 47-day certs” on DelegatedSSL would talk about how agencies need to adjust processes to handle more frequent renewals (maybe suggesting an upsell of services to clients) – distinct from KeylessSSL’s tech angle or AutoCertify’s warning angle. And absolutely avoid copy-pasting any chunks from the other sites; even definitions should be rephrased. The SEO spec reminds us Google’s near-duplicate detection (shingles, WebMirror) will penalize if we reuse text too closely. Where identical wording is unavoidable (e.g., legal footer text, product name references), it’s fine, but if it’s a whole page, then we designate one canonical. For instance, if “Multi-Brand Privacy Policy” were identical, we’d noindex two and let one be canonical – but ideally, we just customize each enough to avoid this.
Cross-Brand Linking
DelegatedSSL will not have any routine cross-links to the sister sites in navigation or footers. The only time we link to KeylessSSL or AutoCertify is in a contextual scenario. Example: a DelegatedSSL blog post about agencies reselling SSL might mention, “If you’re a developer building this in-house, consider our developer API at KeylessSSL.dev.” Or on an AutoCertify page for small biz, there might be a line “Are you an agency managing many sites? See DelegatedSSL.” – those are contextual and allowed. For DelegatedSSL specifically, one likely cross-link is from AutoCertify’s site: after a user fixes their single site, a prompt “Manage websites for others? Try DelegatedSSL.” might appear – we’ll accept that inbound. But on DelegatedSSL’s own site, we might only link out to AutoCertify in a subtle way, e.g., “Have just one site? Our sister service AutoCertify might suit you.” on an FAQ, and even that only once. The rule is max 1 cross-domain link per page and only where relevant. All cross-links should use descriptive anchor text (no “click here”). E.g., “SSL for SaaS – see KeylessSSL” or “fix Not Secure warnings – see AutoCertify” so Google understands they serve different intents and we’re not spamming.
Site Architecture and Noindexing
DelegatedSSL’s site is split into marketing pages (indexable) and app (non-indexable), same as others. We will:
Use portal.delegatedssl.com (for example) for the app/dashboard and set it to noindex globally. The app shares functionality with the other brands, so search engines should not see it. Robots.txt for portal subdomain will disallow all, and X-Robots-Tag headers ensure no accidental indexing.
The primary domain delegatedssl.com hosts landing pages: Home, Features, Pricing, How It Works, Solutions (if any), Docs, Blog, FAQ, etc. Each of these pages gets a self-referencing canonical tag to itself, and absolutely none should point their canonical to keylessssl.dev or autocertify.net. If we ever intentionally duplicate (which we won’t, except maybe a press release), we’d choose one canonical domain, but let’s avoid that.
We’ll choose non-www (delegatedssl.com) as canonical host, and 301 redirect any www.delegatedssl.com to the root domain. Similarly, enforce HTTPS.
DelegatedSSL gets its own sitemap.xml listing only its pages, and a robots.txt that allows those and lists the sitemap URL. No mention of the other domains in either file. We also keep its GSC (Search Console) profile separate to monitor it individually.
Template and Layout Differences
DelegatedSSL’s page templates should diverge from the others in meaningful ways to avoid the “similar neighbors” problem in search results. According to the SEO spec, here’s what’s required for DelegatedSSL:
Enterprise-style Layout: DelegatedSSL will use a more classic SaaS/enterprise website design: top navigation bar with drop-downs if needed (e.g., a “Solutions” menu or “Resources” menu) instead of a docs-style sidebar. The navigation links center around Product, Solutions, Pricing, Security, Docs (as noted in the spec). This differs from KeylessSSL which emphasizes docs in nav, and AutoCertify which has a very simplified nav.
Rich Marketing Sections: Expect sections like case studies, ROI calculators, compliance/security trust badges on DelegatedSSL pages. For instance, the homepage might have a stripe of logos of “Agencies that trust us” or a calculated statement like “Save ~$X per client site per year.” The presence of these sections (and possibly a heavier use of images) will set DelegatedSSL’s HTML structure apart from Keyless’s, which is more text/code heavy, and AutoCertify’s, which is simpler.
Schema Markup: DelegatedSSL might leverage Organization schema for itself and maybe CaseStudy schema for any case study content. This not only is good SEO practice but also differentiates the content (autoCertify might use FAQ schema heavily, Keyless might use TechArticle, etc.).
Content Ordering: KeylessSSL had “Architecture/Integration” high on the page. AutoCertify emphasizes the “How it works” quickly. DelegatedSSL, by contrast, leads with pain points & features, then maybe a workflow later, and an FAQ. This variation in order (e.g., having an explicit “Testimonials” section or a “Clients” section that others lack) helps ensure the DOM structure isn’t a near-match across brands.
Styling: DelegatedSSL uses a light theme with blues and teals, whereas Keyless is dark and AutoCertify uses green accents. This means CSS and possibly structure (dark mode might use different markup for toggling) differ. While style alone doesn’t guarantee SEO distinction, the spec encourages separate layout components – so likely we implement entirely separate React/Vue components for each brand’s sections rather than reusing identical markup with different text.
Content Guidelines for DelegatedSSL Pages
When writing content, use agency/business vernacular. For SEO, this means targeting keywords like “white label ssl”, “manage client ssl certificates”, “SSL for SaaS platforms”. We incorporate these naturally: e.g., a blog title “How to Manage Client SSL Certificates at Scale (Without Killing Your Margins)” hits several terms. Persona-native vocabulary: instead of saying “API” or “CLI” (which Keyless would), DelegatedSSL copy might say “dashboard,” “platform,” “portal,” etc. It talks about “clients” and “end-users” more than “domains” alone. It might mention “maintenance packages” (as in the sales deck line about bundling SSL into maintenance). This ensures even if topics overlap, the wording signals a different target reader (Google picks up on that through NLP).
Monitoring & QA
From an SEO ops perspective, we will continuously monitor DelegatedSSL’s site for duplicate content and indexing issues:
Use Google Search Console to watch if any pages are flagged as duplicates of others (like “Duplicate, Google chose a different canonical”). If we see any for DelegatedSSL pages, we’ll inspect and adjust content/canonicals accordingly.
Run periodic checks (the spec suggests weekly) to compare DelegatedSSL’s key pages vs the other brands for similarity score. If similarity is high, that’s a red flag to rewrite or restructure the page immediately (to avoid “doorway cluster” penalties).
Following these rules, DelegatedSSL.com will maintain a clear identity in the eyes of search engines: a site about white-label, multi-client SSL management. It will rank for queries relevant to agencies/MSPs (like “white label SSL dashboard” or “manage multiple SSL certificates”), and won’t be conflated with KeylessSSL (developer queries) or AutoCertify (panic fix queries).
