## Implementation Notes

### Automatic Brand Detection

The brand is detected automatically based on hostname:
```typescript
// In useBrandTheme.ts
if (hostname === 'autocertify.net' || hostname === 'www.autocertify.net') {
  return 'autocertify';
}
return 'dcvaas'; // default
```

### CSS Variable System

AutoCertify theme is applied via CSS variables:
```css
:root[data-brand="autocertify.net"] {
  --color-primary: #15803D;
  --color-success: #15803D;
  --color-surface: #F0FDF4;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Copy Management

All copy is centralized in configuration files:
- `src/lib/brand-copy.ts` - Marketing/landing copy
- `src/lib/dashboard-copy.ts` - Portal/dashboard copy

Components access copy dynamically:
```typescript
const brand = getBrand();
const copy = getBrandCopy(brand);
// Use copy.heroHeadline, copy.heroPrimaryCTA, etc.
```
